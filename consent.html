        <p style="text-align: center"><i>Encoding and Influence of Social Network Knowledge: Social Network Survey</i><p>
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>Carolyn Parkinson, PhD from the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles are conducting a research study. This study is being funded by National Science Foundation. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because your residential community (i.e., floor) was selected to be part of this study and you have indicated interest in participating. Your participation in this research study is voluntary.</p>
        <h4>WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT A RESEARCH STUDY?</h4>
        <p class="indent">- Whether or not you take part is up to you.</p>
        <p class="indent">- You can choose not to take part.</p>
        <p class="indent">- You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</p>
        <p class="indent">- Your decision will not be held against you.</p>
        <p class="indent">- You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</p>
        <h4>WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE?</h4>
        <p>The purpose of this research is to understand social networks at UCLA. Findings from this study will uncover the mechanisms behind how people encode social network knowledge and delineate how this knowledge impacts social behaviors. We cannot tell you every detail of this study ahead of time, but if you are willing to participate under these conditions, we will explain the procedure to you fully after your participation.</p>
        <h4>HOW LONG WILL THE RESEARCH LAST AND WHAT WILL I NEED TO DO?</h4>
        <p>Participation in the online survey will take a total of about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:</p>
        <p class="indent">- Answer questions about yourself, such as demographics and personality measures.</p>
        <p class="indent">- Fill out social network information about your social relationships and interactions.</p>
        <p class="indent">- The study will ask you to answer multiple choice and free response questions.</p>
        <p class="indent">- The study will be conducted over the Internet.</p>
        <p class="indent">- You will have the opportunity to participate in behavioral and/or fMRI procedures if interested.</p>
        <h4>ARE THERE ANY RISKS IF I PARTICIPATE?</h4>
        <p>There are no anticipated risks or discomforts.</p>
        <h4>ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS IF I PARTICIPATE?</h4>
        <p>You will not receive direct benefits from participating in the research. However, the results of the research have the potential to elucidate our understanding of how people encode knowledge about their social networks and how this knowledge informs peopleâ€™s behaviors. </p>
        <h4>What other choices do I have if I choose not to participate?</h4>
        <p>Your alternative to participating in this research study is to not participate.</p>
        </br>
        <h4>HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME AND MY PARTICIPATION BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL??</h4>
        <p>The researchers will do their best to make sure that your private information is kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and the potential for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and electronically secured.  As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security.</p>
        <h4>Use of personal information that can identify you:</h4>
        <p>The researchers will do their best to make sure that your private information is kept confidential. Confidentiality on all questionnaires and forms that you complete as part of this study will be maintained by using only a subject identification number, without any other identifying information. The document indicating your name and all other personal identifying information, and the document linking your name with your identification number will be kept separately from your questionnaires. All identifying information will be kept in locked files, and only the principal investigators and their immediate authorized staff will have access to this information. No information that can identify you will be released by the investigators or by their staff without your separate consent except as specifically required by law.</p>
        <h4>How information about you will be stored:</h4>
        <p>Study data will be physically and electronically stored securely in locked cabinets and password-protected or limited-access database, respectively. As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security. All questionnaires and forms that you have completed in this study will be coded with a unique subject identification number with all other personal identifying information excluded. The document associating the assigned subject identification number with your name and other identifiable information will be stored separately in locked files that are accessible only to the principal investigator and authorized staff members in the lab.</p>
        <h4>People and agencies that will have access to your information:</h4>
        <p>The research team and authorized UCLA personnel may have access to study data and records to monitor the study, and only authorized personnel from the research team may have access to personally identifiable data about you. Publications and/or presentations that result from this study will not identify you by any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>Employees of the University may have access to identifiable information as part of routine processing of your information, such as lab work or processing payment. However, University employees are bound by strict rules of confidentiality.</p>
        <h4>USE OF DATA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH</h4>
        <p>Your data, including de-identified data may be kept for use in future research.</p>
        <h4>WILL I BE PAID FOR MY PARTICIPATION?</h4>
        <p>You will receive $20 for completing the online social network survey, plus an additional $5 bonus if over 80% of your floor completes the survey too as social network analysis works best with a high response rate.  </p>
        <p>If you decide that you would like to participate in the behavioral and/or fMRI procedures following the completion of this survey, you will be presented with a separate consent form for these procedures.</p>
        <h4>WHO CAN I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS STUDY?</h4>
