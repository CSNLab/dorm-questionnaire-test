        <h3>CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH</h3>
        <h3>Multirelational Networks and fMRI</h3>
        <p>Carolyn Parkinson, PhD and Mason Porter, PhD, from the Departments of Psychology and Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) are conducting a research study.</p>
        <p>Your participation in this research study is voluntary.</p>
        <h4>Why is this study being done?</h4>
        <p>To understand social networks at UCLA.</p>
        <h4>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</h4>
        <p>If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:</p>
        <p class="indent">- Fill out social network information about your social relationships and interactions</p>
        <p class="indent">- Repeat the above in approximately 9 monthsâ€™ time</p>
        <p class="indent">- You will have the opportunity to do fMRI studies if interested</p>
        <h4>Are there any potential benefits if I participate?</h4>
        <p>You will not receive direct benefits from participating in this study.</p>
        <h4>What other choices do I have if I choose not to participate?</h4>
        <p>At any time you can choose to stop participating in the study and you can request to not be emailed again.</p>
        <h4>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</h4>
        <p>- You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study, and you may withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.</p>
        <p>- Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and no loss of benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.</p>
        <p>- You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.</p>
        <h4>Will I be paid for participating?</h4>
        <p>- You will receive $20 for completing the online social network survey, plus an additional $5 bonus if over 80% of your floor completes the survey too, since social network analysis works best with a high response rate, and a $5 bonus if you complete the survey twice.</p>
        <p>- If you decide you would also like to participate in the longitudinal fMRI study, you will also receive $50 for each of the two visits that are part of that study (total $100). Each fMRI session involves approximately 90 minutes inside of the MRI scanner. If you terminate your participation, you will receive a pro-rated payment reflecting your participation, rounded up to the nearest half hour. The two fMRI sessions will be approximately 9 months apart.</p>
